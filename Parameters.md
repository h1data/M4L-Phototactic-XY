Step: Changes position at interval time.
Line: moves in a straight line and changes direction at interval time.
Curve: Accelerates towards the randomized position. In this mode, the width of movement is halved to suppress overrun by acceleration.

* X Width
Represents the ratio of movements for X coordinate.

* Y Width
Represents the ratio of movements for Y coordinate.

* Link Width
Toggles to equal the X and Y width.

* Interval 
Represents the interval time of movements.
It moves every sample in 0ms but most parameters in devices/plugins would not be supported to the rate.

* Attract
Represents the ratio how random movements is attracted by the attractor.

* X Position
